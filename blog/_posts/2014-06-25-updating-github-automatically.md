You need to setup git and the [ssh keys with github](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys) so the clone and push commands can autheticate automatically.

I'm planning on using a similar approach to make [data files](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/datafiles/) programatically available to this website.
