- [Survey of Pythonic tools for RDF and Linked Data programming](http://www.michelepasin.org/blog/2011/02/24/survey-of-pythonic-tools-for-rdf-and-linked-data-programming/)
- [Linking the world with Python and Semantics](http://www.slideshare.net/alchueyr/getting-the-most-out-of-sparql-with-python)

## Tools

	> The goal of RDF Alchemy is to allow anyone who uses  python to have a object type API access to an RDF Triplestore.
	> The same way that:
	> - SQLAlchemy is an ORM (Object Relational Mapper) for relational database users
	> - RDFAlchemy is an ORM (Object RDF Mapper) for semantic web users.
